A. The Power of Tourism
What do we mean when we talk about “T ourism”?
A partial definition of “ Tourism” includes the idea of :
People traveling for vacations and visits to places of interest.
The Concept of Choosing to Travel
Naturally, most people choose to travel to places that interest them and/or where they have friends or relatives or are attending a meeting. They go to places where they think they’ll have an enjoyable experience. Unless it’s a
mandatory business meeting, no one forces them – they CHOOSE to go!
CHOOSING to travel is a
critically important concept to grasp, because it is the
backbone of the tourism industry.
People choose to go to one
city over another for many reasons: appeal of the destination, affordability,
geography, etc.
The Power of Tourism
Module 1 – Reading
Now, think about what it is like when fewer visitors come here. For example, a
pandemic, natural disaster or when our economy is strained.
 People choose not to travel
 Tourism plummets , entire tourism industry suffers
 Businesses close, people are laid off
 Local and state economies are greatly affected
This shows how important tourism is to our
economy and our destination!
What have you experienced at your job?
Have you seen the impact of les s touri sm?
Tourism Is Big Business
When you think of tourism in the broad sense, it’s big business. It means new money
flowing into a city or region that wouldn’t be there without the visitor.
What about The Palm Beaches ? In our area, tourism:
• Accounts for over 9 million visitors each year
• Equates to $10 billion in economic impact
• Creates 85,000 jobs in Palm Beach County
The economic impact of tourism is huge and is why we constantly see advertisements
trying to lure us to a certain destination. Competition for the tourist dollar is fierce and
is gaining increasingly more importance to countries, states and cities everywhere!
TRAVEL & TOURISM :
• Is a $2.6 trillion industry nationwide: $6.8 billion per day!
• Creates 15. 8 million jobs
• Constitutes 1 of every 10 jobs in the U.S.
• Generates $179.7 billion in local/state/federal tax
revenues, keeping YOU from paying $1, 400 in
additional federal taxes per year !
The $10 billion in economic impact
creates a “ripple effect” throughout the entire region .
Example: Think about the products or services a single hotel buy s to serve
its guests: f ood, sodas, liquor, china, linens, furniture, bedding, towels, etc .
Now, think about ALL the hotels, restaurants, attractions, and other
businesses in our area that buy these or other products. They stay in business
because of the spending created by tourists! When the visitors don’t come,
these businesses suffer. When they do come, the businesses grow. New
restaurants open, new attractions open and our areas become more
appealing to the visitor and more pleasant for us, as well!

back into our local
infrastructure
Across the world, Convention & Visitors Bureaus or Destination
Marketing Organizations are working to convince people to come
experience what their destinations have to offer.
Since their beginnings in the 1920s, CVBs have worked to brin g conference
attendees and tourists to their area . Leaders from more than 1,000 CVBs and
DMOs around the world meet each year to share ideas and to discuss industry
research and key issues. T hey are friendly competitor s, competing for the same
tourists. And their “product” – the destination ’s appeal, attractions, and its
people – make it an easy or difficult “sell.”
Working Together to Lure More Visitors
In The Palm Beaches area, there are numerous organizations that are working
together to advertise and promote our area to bring more visitors, including:
• Restaurants
• Attractions
• Hotels
• Cultural Organizations
In addition, Discover The Palm
Beaches works closely with specific
organizations in our community to
promote The Palm Beaches ’ many
attributes including local government,
chambers of commerce , economic
development agencies, restaurant
and tourism associations, airports,
and more. All are working together to deliver a special brand promise for our area . It’s extremely competitive
out there – even more reason for our
area ’s CTAs to shine for our visitors !
Discover The Palm Beaches
Marketing Ad vertisement
When you think of a city, do you think of a brand?
You may not realize it, but you probably do.
What comes to mind when you think of the following cities?
EXERCISE: Next to each, write the first few things that come to mind.
Orlando: ________________________________________________________
San Francisco: ___________________________________________________
Las Vegas: ______________________________________________________
Chances are, what you wrote describes their brand. And, whether you realized it or not,
you most likely recalled something that has an EMOTIONAL APPEAL . Examples might
be San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge with the water flowing below or Las Vegas’
nightlife and fun.
A destination ’s brand encompasses:
• Its “personality”
• What a visitor remembers most
• What they tell their friends
Destinations work to create slogans and logos that capture the essence of their brand.
And they work to deliver that brand through a Brand Promise.
What is a Brand Promise?
It’s what a destination hopes to deliver to every visitor – the experience they want them
to have. It takes all CTAs working together to do the little things that add up to an
experience that visitors can’t get anywhere else.
Now, think of a brand for our area …
What is the “personality” and brand of The Palm Beaches ?
What do people expect when they come here?
What emotions do people feel when they’re here?
What will they remember?
What will they tell their friends?
Discover The Palm Beaches uses the following tag line in promoting our
destination to leisure travelers and convention planners alike.
The Original. The One. The Only.
Brand Promise
The Palm Beaches are America's First Resort Destination. The community where genuine
hospitality is a way of life, and the diversity of travel experiences is matched by the warmth of its coastal communities. It is Florida's finest travel experience .
To strengthen the brand, Discover The Palm Beaches uses social media sites such as
Facebook , Instagram , and X to talk about our unique attractions and events and uses
videos on YouTube to expose visitors to everything from local restaurants to historic sites to nature trails. We also use an abundance of photograph s – images that convey
our beautiful beaches , luxurious hotels , and stunning architecture.
These words and images are part of our ‘Brand Message.’ However, it is all of us on the
front-line who help us keep our Brand Promise – to ensure that the uniqueness we are
promoting is what the visitor will experience.
People visit our area for many reasons – they may come to visit friends or relatives,
attend an event, or to get away for a few days. Our current, broad breakdown is:

EXERCISE —Put Your Sales Hat On
Marketing a destination is not an easy job. Imagine yourself a salesperson for Discover The Palm Beaches. What would you say to a prospective visitor to “sell”
them on coming here? Or , to a person who was considering bringing a meeting or
conference here?
Write some of the key points you would mention:
• Beautiful beaches and architecture
• Rich cultural heritage
• Vibrant fine arts and performing arts
• Friendly people
• Incredible outdoor recreation
• World -class hotels, resorts , and spas
• Wide variety of shopping options
• Renowned culinary scene and offerings
Impressing Meeting Planners
Now, think about meeting planners coming here with the idea of possibly bringing a
meeting or convention here. The CVB shows them around, but they also go out on their
own. And, when they do, they’re looking at EVERYTHING – the cleanliness of the area ,
what there is to do, how their attendees can get around, and most important, the
service they receive.
Locals as Marketers for Our Destination
From another angle, many area residents are members of associations, such as the
National Association of Realtors or the American Bar Association. There is an association
for virtually everything and it’s been estimated that more than half of the people who
live in our area belong to at least one. Also, think about our area’s business owners who
could possibly bring a business meeting here. What if our residents were to feel so
confident about our area and the product it delivers that they all wanted to bring their meeting or convention here? Think of the thousands of visitors this would generate and
the impact it would have on you and your job!
But residents won’t feel comfortable recommending our area as a meeting or
convention site unless and until they believe in their hearts that our area is exceptional
– that it will provide a quality experience for their attendees. Unless they see the brand
of the city as an exciting, fun, quality -service destination, they won’t bother.
Some who live in The Palm Beaches and the surrounding area may take for granted
how truly special it is – how beautiful, how much fun, how welcoming .
Working Together
Think of the potential impact that you and your fellow CTAs could have working
together to bring more business here. In some cases, which would mean changing our
attitudes from negative to positive. It implies that we all meet the challenge of
something very important.
F. Positive Messages
Sending Out Positive Messages , Always !
Do you cringe when you hear someone disparaging where we live? Or sending them to a
restaurant in a city/town outside our area?
From the Negative …
“There’s not much to do here.”
“Everything shuts down
after 9:00 p.m.”
To the Positive …
“We have a lot of exciting
things to see and do.”
“There’s a lot of nightlife,
may I help you find it?”
When the Experience is Negative
People are naturally disappointed when they hear locals expressing these (or
other) negative thoughts.
When someone says something negative, it “sticks .” Visitors remember it, and
it becomes part of their perception of your area .
When you had a bad experience while eatin g out or on vacation , what EMOTIONS
did you experience?
Frustration?
Anger?
Helplessness?
Wasted Time?
Wasted Money?
“Let’s just go back to our hotel.”
“I’ll never come back here again.”
“Let’s leave tomorrow .”
“I can’t wait to tell everyone what a terrible experience this was.”
This bad experience probably resulted in the following:
 Lower tips to the worker
 Lost future business
 Bad word -of-mouth or posts
CTAs need to work together …to make sure that everything said is posit ive.
When the Experience is Positive
Now, think about what you feel when you have a positive experience eating out or
while on vacation .
What d id you experience?
Excitement?
Fun?
Fond Memory?
“I can’t wait to come back here!”
“This was fun; let’s go on to another place!”
“Let’s stay an extra day.”
“I can’t wait to tell others what a
wonderful experience this was.”
This positive experience probably resulted in:
 More tips
 More business for the company
 More visitors returning and telling others
A restaurant can have a great menu, but if the service is bad in any way, it won’t be
around for long. A local attraction can have interesting things to see and do, but if
workers aren’t helpful and friendly, customers will not want to return and they’re not
likely to recommend it to others.
The difference is YOU!
You can give a visitor a good or bad experience, thereby influencing future decisions
to return here.
Bottom Line…we’re all marketers for our destination .
Our area has much to offer. But one of the best things we have to offer is YOU!
Whether you realize it or not, you play a key role in keeping tourism secure for our community and in convincing more people to visit. I n simple terms…
YOU are the Brand!
A lot of what visitors feel , remember, and tell others will depend on the experience they
had while they were here. YOU are a vital, inseparable part of that experience!
Every CTA is a purveyor of the brand. You strengthen or weaken the brand with your action or inaction .
Who gets the questions about things to see and do? YOU
Who gets a chance to create a positive and memorable experience? YOU
Who helps create our area’s personality? YOU
