Cool Trivia
It’s been said that trivia is not useless information…
it’s knowledge waiting for a home !
• In 1867, due to the absence of roads, a mail carrier walked barefoot along the
beaches to deliver mail from Jupiter to Miami, earning the nickname "beach walker." This route, known as the "Barefoot Route," was suspended after two
years for unknown reasons. In 1884, the United States Postal Service revived the
136-mile route from Palm Beach to Miami due to increased population. Mail carriers, now called "Barefoot Mailmen," walked the beaches and used boats for a 28-mile segment, completing the round trip in six days. The term "Barefoot
Mailman" emerged around 50 years later when a rock road was completed in
1893.
• Several African American artists known as the Highwaymen painted and sold
their works featuring Florida’s natural landscapes along the Atlantic coast from the 1950s to the 1970s. Known for their speed, resourcefulness, and creativity,
they employed quick strokes that contributed to an impressionistic style, allowing
them to produce multiple paintings daily, which they sold for around $25 each.
Despite lacking professional training , they supported themselves through their
art during and after segregation, producing over 200,000 paintings that were in high demand.
• In 1961, the U.S. government built a bunker for President Kennedy on Peanut
Island . The bunker was located minutes away from the Kennedy’s Palm Beach
home , known as the “Winter White House .” During this time in the Cold War,
relations with the Soviet Union were very much on edge, and the bunker was
built quickly and quietly to protect the president should war break out.
