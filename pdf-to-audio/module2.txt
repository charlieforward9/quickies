Natural Assets
Visitors also ask about our climate and natural features. Here’s a snapshot of what
makes our area so wonderful.
Our Climate
• It’s no wonder that Florida is called The Sunshine State . For more than 125 years,
The Palm Beaches have been renowned as the warm -weather getaway by
visitor s.
• The area has a subtropical climate with warm summers and very mild winters.
Humidity throughout the year runs from approximately 66-75%.
• Palm Beach County’s pleasant weather is in part due to its proximity to the Gulf
Stream, which flow s through the Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream is like a warm
river flowing through the ocean and is located only about a mile offshore from
Palm Beach County , near the Lake Worth Inlet . The breezes that accompany the
Gulf Stream warm Palm Beach County in the winter and cool it in the summer,
creating the comfortable temperatures you see below.

Our Geology and Geography
• Palm Beach County is located in the southeastern portion of the state of Florida.
The county is bordered to the north by Martin County, to the east by the Atlantic
Ocean, to the south by Broward County, to the west by Hendry County and the
northwest by Lake Okeechobee.
• The geology of southeastern Florida is different than the geology of central and
western Florida in that the sand layer on top is much deeper . The layer beneath
the sand is limestone that runs through the entire state. Because the sand layer
Section 9 – Our Climate & Natural Assets
it. This means that the area is not prone to sinkholes as are other parts of the
state.
• The northern reaches of t he Everglades , a subtropical freshwater wetland
spanning two million acres across central and southern Florida , are located in
Palm Beach Count y. During the summer, Lake Okeechobee overflows, releasing
water into a very slow -moving, shallow river dominated by sawgrass marsh. The
water flows southward at the rate of a quarter mile per day, passing through
diverse habitats, including cypress swamps, wet prairie, and mangroves until it
reaches Everglades National Park and eventually Florida Bay on the southern tip
of Florida.30 The Everglades are often referred to as a “river of grass .” The
Everglades have shrunk in recent history due to dredging, pumping, and draining
of the sloughs .
• The western part of the county is known for its soil, often called “black gold.”
This black soil comes from the remnants of the Everglades that were once located
here, consisting of decomposed plants that fell underwater in the Everglades thousands of years ago. It is filled with nutrients and is great for growing crops,
which is why agriculture is a popular economic driver in this area.
• Just offshore are 47 miles of natural coral reefs that run parallel to Palm Beach
County’s coastline. These reefs were created thousands of years ago and are part
of a reef that runs 360 miles from the St. Lucie Inlet to the Dry Tortugas, one of
the largest coral reef ecosystems in the continental U.S. In recent years, the
Palm Beach County government has added to the reef, creating artificial reefs
out of limestone, concrete, and occasionally decommissioned ships to provide habitat for coral, algae, and other marine life, as well as more locations for divers
to see marine life. The County’s Environmental Resources Management
depart ment has deployed over 49 vessels, 110,000 tons of concrete, and 140,000
tons of limestone boulders to create these artificial reefs.

Boating in the Everglades
-c anoeing -
everglades- palm -beach- county/
• The Atlantic Ocean makes up the entire eastern flank of Palm Beach County. It is
the second-largest ocean in the world stretching from North and South America
on the west to Europe and Africa on the east. All of our beaches are located along
the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.
• Lake Okeechobee is the largest freshwater lake in the state of Florida. Its name
comes from the Seminole language where “oki” means “water” and “chubi”
means “big .” The lake is 730 square miles in area and is shallow, averaging a
depth of nine feet. It supports a diverse habitat and is home to a variety of
mammals and aquatic life. It is known as a great place for fishing and waterfowl
hunting. Boating is popular on the lake, as well as wildlife siting, camping , and
hiking along the 109- mile Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail .
• Lake Mangonia is a 540- acre inland lake in the heart of West Palm Beach. Boating
and fishing are popular here. The waters of Lake M angonia travel through a canal
into the main body of Clear Lake, located just south of Lake Mangonia.
• Clear Lake is a 401-acre lake. Hiking and fishing are popular activities .
• Lake Osborne is a well- stocked lake with boat launching ramps and fishing piers ,
located at John Prince Memorial Park. Camping is also available.
• Lake Ida is a 190-acre lake located in Delray Beach. Fishing, jet skiing, and
wakeboarding are available on the lake. Several parks are also located along
its shores.
• The Loxahatchee River is a 7.6 -mile river that has three main forks that form
together before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter. The northwest fork of the river is one of only two federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers in
Florida. Once the three forks join, t he water becomes part freshwater and part
saltwater as it mixes with the incoming tides of the ocean. Lake Okeechobee

Worth Creek, and Jupiter Sounds. Part of the flow of the St. Lucie and Indian
Rivers diverted to the ocean through the Jupiter Inlet , as well. However, in 1892,
the construction of the St. Lucie Inlet made an artificial cut through the barrier
strip about six miles north of the Jupiter Inlet. The altered hydrodynamics
facilitated the need for management of the Jupiter Inlet to reduce shoaling and
maintain a navigable channel. To achieve this, the inlet was moved approximately 1,250 feet north to its present position beginning in 1913. The project entailed
cutting a channel across the sand barrier, building a new barrier across the natural Southeasterly channel to divert the flow through the new opening, and constructing two jetties. The work was completed nine years later in 1922. Work
has continued on the inlet since this time to maintain transportation channels.
• The Intracoastal Waterway is a shipping route in the U.S. that runs for 3,000
miles along the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico. As mentioned, it facilitates
transportation by avoiding the sometimes- unpredictable open ocean waters.
• The Lake Worth Lagoon is a critical environmental and recreational asset to
Palm Beach County. Its vital estuarine ecosystem stretch es more than 20 miles
from North Palm Beach to Boynton Beach . It plays a crucial role in supporting our
region’s biodiversity, serving as a habitat for various fish, birds, and marine life,
as well as providing an essential breeding and feeding ground with substantive
mangroves, seagrasses, and oyster reefs. The lagoon also provides significant
economic advantages with plenty of activities for residents and tourists alike.
In Case of Emergency
• Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30 and visitors are
advised to follow these steps to stay safe during a hurricane32:
o If ordered to evacuate, leave immediately .
o Follow evacuation routes and do not try to take shortcuts as they may be
blocked.
o If possible, take water, food, a flashlight, a radio, a first aid kit, any
medications, cell phones and chargers, extra cash, family and emergency

o Check with local officials for shelter locations. A free Red Cross Emergency
App is available to download on smart phones from Google Play or the App Store.
o Check for m
ore information prior, during, and
after the storm to help support visitors in the destination.
Our Flora and Fauna
• Sea turtles are commonly seen offshore , the most common being Leatherbacks,
Loggerheads, Green, Kemps Ridley, and Hawksbill. Our beaches lead the nation
in the number of sea turtle nests per mile, producing approximately 2 million
hatchlings per year.33
• Manatees and bottlenose dolphins are also often spotted in our waters,
delighting visitors and residents alike.
• American alligators may be spotted in Palm Beach County. They live in
freshwater and brackish environments. When
they are young, alligators eat fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and worms. As they get larger, they eat larger prey such as large fish, turtles, muskrats, birds, deer, and other reptiles.
34 Encourage visitors to steer clear of alligators.
• The sand dunes i n the eastern portion of Palm Beach County offer a desert -like
climate and host a plant community called the Sand Pine Scrub. This ecosystem is
home to several endangered species that depend on the Sand Pine Scrub for survival. This includes the Florida Scrub -Jay and the Florida Scrub Lizard . The
Florida Dancing Lady Orchid is also found only in this area.
• Tropical hardwood hammocks are found along both coasts of south Florida and
in the Everglades and Florida Keys. A tropical hardwood hammock is a closed -
canopy forest dominated by a variety of evergreen and semi-deciduous trees and
scrubs that is often higher in elevation from the rest of the land. The hammocks in Palm Beach County are made up mainly of tropical flora originating in the
Manatees

winds, and water currents over a long period of time. Today, there are more than
120 species of tropical plants, 36 of which are listed as endangered or
threatened. Examples include Bahama strongbark, buccaneer palm, Florida
boxwood, and milkbark.35
• Palm trees are often associated with Florida. Only 12 palm trees are native to
the state, as follows:
o Buccaneer Palm
o Sabal Palm – Florida’s State Tree
o Dwarf Palmetto
o Everglades Palm
o Needle Palm
o Thatch Palm
o Silver Palm

• In 1867, due to the absence of roads, a mail carrier walked barefoot along the
beaches to deliver mail from Jupiter to Miami, earning the nickname "beach walker." This route, known as the "Barefoot Route," was suspended after two
years for unknown reasons. In 1884, the United States Postal Service revived the
136-mile route from Palm Beach to Miami due to increased population. Mail carriers, now called "Barefoot Mailmen," walked the beaches and used boats for a 28-mile segment, completing the round trip in six days. The term "Barefoot
Mailman" emerged around 50 years later when a rock road was completed in
1893.
• Several African American artists known as the Highwaymen painted and sold
their works featuring Florida’s natural landscapes along the Atlantic coast from the 1950s to the 1970s. Known for their speed, resourcefulness, and creativity,
they employed quick strokes that contributed to an impressionistic style, allowing
them to produce multiple paintings daily, which they sold for around $25 each.
Despite lacking professional training , they supported themselves through their
art during and after segregation, producing over 200,000 paintings that were in high demand.
• In 1961, the U.S. government built a bunker for President Kennedy on Peanut
Island . The bunker was located minutes away from the Kennedy’s Palm Beach
home , known as the “Winter White House .” During this time in the Cold War,
relations with the Soviet Union were very much on edge, and the bunker was
built quickly and quietly to protect the president should war break out.
